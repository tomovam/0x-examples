# What is 0x?

0x allows builders to embed swaps in their onchain apps. Tap into aggregated liquidity from 130+ sources, across 15+ EVM chains with the most efficient trade execution. Our suite of APIs has processed over 60M+ million transactions and $154B+ in volume from more than 9+ million users trading on apps like Matcha.xyz, Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood Wallet, Phantom, Metamask, Zerion, Zapper, and more.

# Why use 0x?

At 0x, we believe all forms of value will eventually be tokenized and settle on-chain. But as more value becomes tokenized, liquidity becomes increasingly fragmented â€” across chains, across liquidity sources, and across protocols.

0x offers powerful APIs to simplify access to this fragmented liquidity:

    Swap API - The most efficient liquidity aggregator for ERC20 tokens through a single API.
    Gasless API - Never lose a user trade because of gas. Easily build frictionless apps with end-to-end gasless infra.
    Trade Analytics API - Programatically access historical trades initiated through your apps via 0x Swap and Gasless APIs.

# Makers and Takers

Within the 0x Ecosystem, there are two sides to a trade - Makers and Takers:

## Supply Side (Makers)

This is the entity who creates 0x orders and provides liquidity into the system for the Demand side (Takers) to consume. 0x aggregates liquidity from multiple sources including:

    On-chain liquidity - DEXs, AMMs (e.g. Uniswap, Curve, Bancor)
    Off-chain liquidity - Professional Market Makers, 0x's Open Orderbook network

Demand Side (Takers)

## Takers consume token liquidity from Makers. They are applications or agents that initiate trades using the 0x protocol. This includes:

    Wallets
    Portfolio trackers
    SocialFi platforms
    AI agents
    Token screeners
    And more

    Gasless API - enable developers to build frictionless apps with end-to-end gasless infrastructure

# How does 0x work?

    Order Creation: A Maker creates a 0x order, a JSON object that follows a standard format.
    Maker Signature: The Maker signs the order to cryptographically commit to it.
    Order Sharing: The order is shared with potential Takers:
        Directly (e.g., via an app)
        Or through the Open Orderbook if no counterparty is known
    Aggregation: 0x API aggregates liquidity across all supply sources and surfaces the best price.
        This is done using off-chain relay, on-chain settlement, saving gas and improving flexibility.
    Order Submissions: A Taker fills the order onchain by signing it and submitting it along with the fill amount.
    Order Settlement: The 0x Settler verifies the signature, checks trade conditions, and atomically swaps assets between Maker and Taker.

# What can I build on 0x?

0x powers a wide variety of web3 applications. Whether you're building a product where trading is central â€” like an exchange â€” or adding seamless token swaps to an app where trading is just one feature, 0x makes it easy to plug in liquidity.
